In case you missed it from the previous video here is again how to install a third party Python library (e.g. glob2 ). 

Simply open your command line / terminal and execute:

pip install glob2 

If that doesn't work then do this:

python -m pip install glob2 

If you have multiple Pythons (both version 2 and 3) installed you may need to use pip3:

pip3 install glob2 

If that doesn't work please execute:

python3 -m pip install glob2
